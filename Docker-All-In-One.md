## Three Basic Commands
### docker build
 a declarative model in which a Dockerfile represents how to build a container, and the command runs on this file. The file contains at the start a from command that represents the base image to start from, and then it contains a series of commands that represent configuring the container and the underlying images. 
### docker compose
 a declarative service model in which multiple containers or build files represent a service; for example, a website in one container and a data store in another, which are always required. 
### docker run
 starts a container that is already built by either pulling from a central repository or locally.
